My name is Tetiana (“Tania”) and I am a postdoctoral researcher in the QuMAP group led by Juri Smirnov. I come from Kyiv, Ukraine and have travelled extensively around the world in the pursuit of fascinating science. I hold a PhD degree in particle physics from the Niels Bohr Institute in Copenhagen, Denmark, where I focused on constraining the unitarity of the neutrino mixing matrix  using the atmospheric neutrino oscillation data from the IceCube Neutrino Observatory at the South Pole. Within the QuMAP group, my research focuses on sub-GeV dark matter searches with the QUEST-DMC experiment. I am broadly interested in physics Beyond the Standard Model, development of advanced statistical methods and data analysis techniques, intersections between dark matter and neutrino physics, condensed matter physics, and novel detector technologies
